docker
=====

<i>docker</i> is a remake of the OSX dock and its magnification feature. Built with the [Famous](http://famo.us) library, the dock icons dynamically expand as you hover the mouse, shifting adjacent icons appropriately. Clicking on the icon brings up a surface, which in this demo simply shows an upscaled version of the icon. In a real app, this surface could host any element(s).

Installation
========

This app may be run by simply opening index.html.  A webserver is not necessary though you could certainly run one to host this.

This app works best in a desktop browser as it listens for the mouseover event to size the icon. Because the dock is sized according to the browser width, it's best to maximize the browser before opening or refreshing the page.

License
======

GPL v2 is to keep the lawyering types at bay. All I really ask is that you credit where the code came from if you use it.
